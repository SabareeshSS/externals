TODO

- Add "remove" command

DONE

- Create a "fill_options" method in the 'projects/scms' classes to fill in opts
Basically, everything specific to an scm belongs in those files and no where else. 
Currently the filling of scm specific options (such as --git and --svn) occurs in
ext.rb which is not OK.
