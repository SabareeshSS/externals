Externals is a project that allows you to use the workflow normally made
possible by svn:externals in an SCM independent manner.

I was inspired to create this project because I had several projects that had
a mix of plugins managed by git and by svn.  Git's submodule feature is 
not exactly like svn:externals.  Basically, I don't like how you have to manually 
checkout a branch, and I don't like git status not propagating through the 
submodules.  Also, the branch tip doesn't automatically move with git-submodule.
Subversion always checks out the branch tip for subprojects when performing a 
checkout or update.

Externals is designed such that adding support for a new SCM is easy.

The externals executable is called ext.  Commands come in a long form and a 
short form.  The longer form applies the action to the main project.  The short 
forms apply the action to all sub projects.

The commands are as follows:

ext checkout [--git|--svn] <repository>

Tries to determine the SCM to use based on <repository>.   If the repository does
not reveal this information,  use one of the switches to tell ext the scm to use for
the main project.  Once checked out, all of the subprojects are in turn checked out.

ext export [--git|--svn] <repository>

Same as ext checkout but performs an export option instead (for git, does a 
'git clone --depth 1') 

ext status

Performs a status operation for the main project and all subprojects

ext touch_emptydirs

Recurses through the directory tree from the directory it is ran from, and adds
a '.emptydir' file to any empty directories.  This helps with scm's that do not
track empty directories (such as git)

ext update_ignores

Adds the subproject paths to the ignore feature of the top level project.  This 
should rarely need to be ran because 'ext install' automatically updates the ignores
for the main project.

ext install <repository:branch> [path] [project_name]

Adds a subproject to the main project.  If the project_type is set in .externals,
ext can figure out the path on its own (ie, if it's set to rails, if the 
project_name is rails, it will go in vendor/rails, if it's anything else it goes 
in vendor/plugins.)  It will also update the ignores accordingly, that is, for
git entries are added to .gitignore, and for subversion the proper 'svn propset'
commands are ran.  It will then proceed to checkout the added subproject.

ext remove [-d|--delete]<path or name>

Tells externals to no longer manage the specified subproject.  If -d or --delete
are given, the subproject's files will be deleted from the hard disk.  Not yet
implemented.

ext co, ext ex, ext up, ext st
 
All do the same as the longer form, except the action will only be performed on
the subprojects, instead of on the main project and the subprojects.
