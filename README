Externals is a project that allows you to use the workflow normally made
possible by svn:externals in an SCM independent manner.

I was inspired to create this project because I had several projects that had
a mix of plugins managed by git and by svn.  Git's submodule feature is 
not exactly like svn:externals.  Basically, I don't like how you have to manually 
checkout a branch, and I don't like git status not propagating through the 
submodules.  Also, the branch tip doesn't automatically move with git-submodule.
Subversion always checks out the branch tip for subprojects when performing a 
checkout or update.

Externals is designed such that adding support for a new SCM is easy.

The externals executable is called ext.  Commands come in a long form and a 
short form.  The longer form applies the action to the main project.  The short 
forms apply the action to all sub projects.

The commands are as follows:

ext checkout [--git|--svn] <repository>

Tries to determine the SCM to use based on <repository>.   If the repository does
not reveal this information,  use one of the switches to tell ext the scm to use for
the main project.  Once checked out, all of the subprojects are in turn checked out.

ext export [--git|--svn] <repository>

Same as ext checkout but performs an export option instead (for git, does a 
'git clone --depth 1') 

ext status

Performs a status operation for the main project and all some projects

ext update_ignores

Adds the subproject paths to the ignore feature of the top level project.  

ext add <repository:branch> [path] [project_name]

Adds a subproject to the main project.  If the project_type is set in .externals,
ext can figure out the path on its own (ie, if it's set to rails, if the 
project_name is rails, it will go in vendor/rails, if it's anything else it goes 
in vendor/plugins)

ext remove [-d|--delete]<path or name>

Tells externals to no longer manage the specified subproject.  If -d or --delete
are given, the subproject's files will be deleted from the hard disk.

ext co [project_name]

Checks out subproject named by project_name if given, otherwise all subprojects are checked
out.  If a subproject is already checked out, "up" is performed instead.

ext ex [project_name]

like co but does an export and set of checkout.

ext up [project_name]

Updates an already checked out subproject to the current tip of it's branch in the
remote repository.  If  no project name is given, all subprojects are updated.

ext stat [project_name]

Prints out the current status of the subproject, or all subprojects
if no project name is given.
